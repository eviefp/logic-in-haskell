# haskell

See my [Logic in Hakell](https://eevie.ro/posts/2018-12-14-clasical-logic-in-haskell.html) blog 
post for an adequate README.

The interesting bits are in `src/Logic.hs`. You can build using `stack build`.

I personally do `stack build ghcid` and then `make ghcid` in a terminal, while
keeping that terminal next to my editor.

There's nothing interesting in `app/Main.hs` nor in running the executable.
